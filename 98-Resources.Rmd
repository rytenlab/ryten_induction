# Resources {#resources}

Here, sits any general useful resources that cover topics across the spectrum of science.

## How-tos
- [JEFworks](https://jef.works/lab/) - has some sections for writing an abstract, reviewing papers and giving a poster presentation. 

## Reproducible science
- [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) - article with good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill 
- [Improve your workflow for reproducible science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA-vLsN-sic&feature=youtu.be) - video from a 2-hour workshop on using R, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub to improve reproducibility. **This is an excellent primer for new starters on good practices to apply to every research project.** Slides from the workshop are available [here](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/improve-repro-workflow-reproducibilitea-2020/).

## Heritability and LD score regression
- Beginner guides to [defining heritability](http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/13/heritability-101-what-is-heritability) and [estimating heritability](http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/13/heritability-201-types-of-heritability-and-how-we-estimate-it) - these are two excellent blog posts from the Neale lab, which break down the concept of heritability into plain, non-jargon English. 
- [LD Score Regression, Heritability and Partitioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVrF0l9jMgE&list=PLH2ckGEn9kWEkxWkDLkpzQlj8Y1bGM9ZP&index=4) and [Genetic Correlation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVPNouAbXsY&list=PLH2ckGEn9kWEkxWkDLkpzQlj8Y1bGM9ZP&index=3) - two approximately 1-hour YouTube videos from a summer school covering LD score regression. This is a great place to start understanding the underlying principles and assumptions of LDSC.

## Books
- [Jeff Leeks book](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) - free and outlines the core principles behind being a scientist in a open source way.

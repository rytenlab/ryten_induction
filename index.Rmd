# Welcome!

We hope you enjoy your time in the Ryten lab! The goal of this book is to capture the tasks we share as a team and document the things we would have liked to have known throughout our time in the Ryten lab. 

## Useful links

- The Ryten lab [website](https://rytenlab.com/) has all of our backgrounds, developed tools, publications and baby photos. 
- The Ryten lab [GitHub](https://github.com/rytenlab) currently is only used to host this book, however in future will hold any other repositories that are common to the Ryten lab. 
- The Ryten lab [Sharepoint](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/rytenlab/Shared Documents/). To access this, you must be a member of rytenlab (if you are receiving e-mails from rytenlab@live.ucl.ac.uk, then you are a member). If you are a not a member, let one of the existing members know and we'll add you.
- [ICH Laboratory Safety Code](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/rytenlab/Shared%20Documents/WetLab/ICH%20Area%20Safety%20Code%20v1-2.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=dEZwyu). This is hosted on the Ryten lab Sharepoint, thus you must be a memeber to access it.

## Acknowledgements

This book was made possible thanks to the R package `bookdown` [@R-bookdown].

The below code automatically generates `packages.bib`, a `bibtex` format for all the packages listed. If you contribute to this book and include a particular R package in your guide (as with `bookdown` above), consider adding it to the code chunk and citing it via including `[@R-package_name]` in the text.

```{r r_package_references, include = TRUE}
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
